Winding Path - A git experiment

This is a repo to illustrate an odd behaviour in git.

If you're in the know, you run the app like this:

    ./hello dlroW

[stale_branch](https://github.com/Andyvanee/winding-path/tree/stale_branch) is
happily hacking away on the CREDITS file, and I'm merging his changes just fine
even though he really has no idea what he's talking about. His README and
app file are totally out of date, but since he's not editing those, the merges
are very painless.
